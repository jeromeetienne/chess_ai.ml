# chess-bot.ml


A chess bot using machine learning to predict the best move.
Coded with Python and PyTorch.

It has been originally inspired by https://github.com/Skripkon/chess-engine.git

# Machine Learning insights

> "A neural network model on its own cannot produce a reasonable move, as it lacks the depth of calculation required."

## Explaination
A neural network model **alone** doesn't possess the depth of calculation required in chess. In chess terminology, calculation refers to the process of visualizing sequences of moves and countermoves, assessing their consequences, and predicting resulting positions to make the best decision. This depth of calculation is achieved using search algorithms such as [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax), [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning), or [Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search), which systematically explore the game tree to a certain depth. 

AlphaZero exemplifies the synergy between machine learning and traditional search algorithms. It combines a deep neural networkâ€”which evaluates board positions and suggests promising moves, using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a powerful tree search technique. The neural network guides the search by focusing on the most relevant moves, while MCTS provides the depth of calculation needed to explore possible continuations. This integration allows AlphaZero to efficiently balance intuition (from ML) and calculation (from tree search), achieving superhuman performance in chess.

## Inputs encoding
The input is a 8x8x14 tensor representing the chess board. 

Each of the 12 channels corresponds to a piece type (6 for white, 6 for black). 
A value of 1 in a channel indicates the presence of the corresponding piece on that square, while a value of 0 indicates its absence.

The remaining 2 channels are used to encode the legal moves:
- The 13th channel encodes the **from** square of the move (1 if the piece is to be moved from that square, 0 otherwise).
- The 14th channel encodes the **to** square of the move (1 if the piece is to be moved to that square, 0 otherwise).

## Output encoding
The output is a 1968-dimensional vector representing all possible moves on a chessboard based on the dataset.

## Installation

We recommend to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

The dataset is taken from here:https://database.nikonoel.fr/ and put it in `./data/pgn/`

To train a new model, run:

```bash
python ./src/train.py
```

To predict with the trained model, run:

```bash
python ./src/predict.py
```
